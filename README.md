# Parallel quicksort
## Usage

    Usage: 
    quicksort size granularity
    size - size of the array to sort
    granularity - requlates the size of a block for sequential sorting 
        (block = size / granularity)
## Launches
Achieved approximately x1.5-2.5 speed on size = 10^8 and granularity = {10, 100, 1000}
